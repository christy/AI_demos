IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike IVF_FLAT, FLAT directly compares the distances between the target vector based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the most similar cluster(s) only – drastically reducing query time. By adjusting nprobe, an ideal balance between accuracy and speed can be found for a given scenario. Results from the IVF_FLAT performance test demonstrate that query time increases sharply as both the number of target input vectors (nq), and the number of clusters to search (nprobe), increase. IVF_FLAT is the most basic IVF index, and the encoded data stored in each unit is","performance. The default value is 0 , where Milvus automatically selects the team_size based on the vector dimension. 0 GPU_IVF_FLAT Similar to IVF_FLAT, GPU_IVF_FLAT also divides vector data into nlist cluster units, and then compares distances between the target input vector and the center of each cluster. Depending on the number of clusters the system is set to query (nprobe), similarity search results are returned based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the most similar Milvus, and using it does not need data training.

IVF_FLAT IVF_FLAT divides vector data into nlist cluster units, and then compares distances between the target input vector and the center of each cluster. Depending on the number of clusters the system is set to query (nprobe), similarity search results are returned based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the","In the IVF_FLAT index, ""nlist"" refers to the number of clusters into which the vector space is divided, while ""nprobe"" indicates how many of those clusters will be searched during a query.   Adjusting these parameters helps balance accuracy and speed in retrieving nearest vectors.","In IVF_FLAT, ""nlist"" refers to the number of clusters into which the vector data is divided, while ""nprobe"" indicates how many of those clusters will be queried during a similarity search.   Essentially, nlist determines the granularity of clustering and nprobe controls how many clusters are examined for retrieving results.","In an IVF-FLAT index, `nlist` refers to the number of clusters (or lists) that a vector space is divided into. 

On the other hand, `nprobe` represents the number of nearest neighbors from each cluster (`nlist`) that are used for query time reduction.

For example, if you set both `nlist=16384`, and also adjust your nprobe to 128 then Milvus will compare distances between target vector with centers of all clusters (using nlist) but only use the closest nearest neighbors from each cluster (`nprobe`)","In IVF_FLAT, ""nlist"" refers to the number of clusters or bins that vector data is divided into. This determines how many cluster centers are used for similarity search.

On the other hand, ""nprobe"" (short for nearest probe) refers to the maximum number of vectors from each cluster center that will be considered as similar matches during a query operation. In simpler terms, it's like setting a limit on how many closest neighbors you want Milvus to return in your similarity search results.

For example, if nlist is set to 10 and nprobe is also set to 5 within the same cluster center group (i.e., each of those clusters has at most five nearest neighbor vectors), then for any query vector that falls into one of these groups, Milvus will return only its top-5 closest neighbors from all across this particular ""cluster""."
