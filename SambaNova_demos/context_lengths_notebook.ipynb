In Doc1, the relevant section is under \"6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\" The key part here is that Confidential Information is defined as information identified as confidential or that should be reasonably known to be confidential due to its nature. The bold parts here are \"identified as confidential at the time of disclosure\" and \"should be reasonably known to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\" \\n\\nLooking at Doc2, under Section 4b, Confidential Matters, it mentions \"Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Google confidential information. Google confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances.\" The bold parts here are \"marked confidential\" and \"normally be considered confidential under the circumstances.\" \\n\\nThe difference here is that Doc1 emphasizes information identified as confidential at disclosure or reasonably known to be confidential, while Doc2 adds \"marked confidential\" and \"normally considered confidential under the circumstances.\" The practical implication is that Doc1\\'s definition is broader, covering both explicit identification and inherent nature, whereas Doc2 focuses on marked information and what\\'s normally considered confidential, possibly requiring more proactive marking by Google.\\n\\nNext, Permitted Use & Restrictions. In Doc1, Section 1.5 lists several restrictions like reverse engineering, sublicensing, using for benchmarking without consent, etc. The bolded parts here are \"reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any Service,\" \"sell, resell, rent, sublicense, transfer or otherwise make available any Service to a third party,\" and \"publish or disclose information or results relating to capabilities, performance... \\'benchmarking\\' activities.\" \\n\\nIn Doc2, under Section 4a, API Prohibitions, the restrictions include \"Sublicense an API for use by a third party,\" \"Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API,\" and \"Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage.\" The bold parts here are \"Sublicense an API,\" \"extract the source code,\" and specific prohibitions on life-critical uses. \\n\\nThe key difference is that Doc1 explicitly prohibits benchmarking without consent and restricts third-party sharing, while Doc2 uniquely prohibits sublicensing and use in life-critical systems. This means Doc2 has stricter prohibitions on certain high-risk applications and sublicensing, whereas Doc1 focuses more on competitive restrictions like benchmarking.\\n\\nLastly, Data Security. In Doc1, Section 1.1 states that the customer must implement \"reasonable and appropriate measures to help secure the Service\" and report vulnerabilities. The bold parts are \"implement and use reasonable and appropriate measures\" and \"promptly inform us and provide us details of such.\" \\n\\nIn Doc2, Section 3b says, \"You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.\" The bold parts here are \"commercially reasonable efforts\" and \"report to your users.\" \\n\\nThe distinction here is that Doc1 requires the customer to secure the service and report to SambaNova, while Doc2 mandates protecting user data with commercial efforts and reporting breaches to users as required by law. This implies Doc1\\'s focus is on service security towards the provider, whereas Doc2 emphasizes user data protection and transparency with end-users.\\n</think>\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \"topic\": \"Definition of Confidential Information\",\\n    \"summary\": \"Doc1 defines Confidential Information more broadly to include both explicitly identified confidential information and information that should reasonably be recognized as confidential based on its nature.
